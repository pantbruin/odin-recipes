    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pork and veggie filled egg rolls! Great as an appetizer or a side dish to
      be served warm with egg roll sauce or soy sauce, if desired.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 quart peanut oil for frying</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded cabbage</li>
      <li>2 ounces shredded carrots</li>
      <li>8 (7 inch square) egg roll wrappers</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season pork with ginger and garlic powder and mix thoroughly. Heat
        mixture in a medium skillet, stirring, until pork is cooked through and
        no longer pink. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another large skillet heat oil to about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)
        or medium high heat. While oil is heating, combine flour and water in a
        bowl until they form a paste. In a separate bowl combine the cabbage,
        carrots and reserved pork mixture. Mix all together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay out one egg roll skin with a corner pointed toward you. Place about
        a 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the cabbage, carrot and pork mixture on egg roll
        paper and fold corner up over the mixture. Fold left and right corners
        toward the center and continue to roll. Brush a bit of the flour paste
        on the final corner to help seal the egg roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place egg rolls into heated oil and fry, turning occasionally, until
        golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels or rack. Put on
        serving plate and top with sesame seeds if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
